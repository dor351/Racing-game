🏎️ Java Racing Game
Java Racing Game is an interactive 2D racing game developed in Java, simulating realistic racing scenarios across various terrains, including land, air, and sea. This project demonstrates advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the implementation of several design patterns to enhance code modularity and maintainability.

🎮 Key Features
Diverse Racing Arenas: Offers multiple racing environments such as land tracks, aerial courses, and naval routes, each providing unique challenges.​
github.com
Variety of Racers: Includes different types of racers like cars, airplanes, and boats, each with distinct behaviors and attributes.​
Dynamic Racer States: Manages various racer conditions (e.g., Active, Broken, Completed, Disabled) that affect their performance during races.​

Real-Time Updates: Utilizes the Observer pattern to provide immediate feedback on race progress, including racer positions and statuses.​
User-Friendly GUI: Features an intuitive graphical user interface, ensuring an engaging and seamless gaming experience.​
🛠️ Technologies and Design Patterns
Java: The core programming language used for development.​
Design Patterns:
Factory Pattern: Facilitates dynamic creation of various racing arenas.​
Prototype Pattern: Enables efficient cloning of racer objects, promoting flexibility and performance.​
Observer Pattern: Manages real-time notifications and updates within the game.​
State Pattern: Handles the different states of racers, influencing their behavior during the game.​
Model-View-Controller (MVC): Separates the application into three interconnected components, enhancing modularity and scalability.​
Multithreading: Implements concurrent processing to manage racer actions and game logic, ensuring smooth gameplay and responsiveness.​
